##  RoadTrip

This app is designed to help users plan their next road trip.

Check out a walkthrough of the app here: https://youtu.be/whrwrBEfr5s

The current deployed version is here: http://emilyringoen-roadtrip.surge.sh/#weather


### Features

RoadTrip is designed to give users a better planning experience for their future road trips. By incorporating Google Maps API I was able to provide a route for each trip that has been searched. Users can also view total driving distance and duration, as well as anticipated fuel costs. RoadTrip also provides a five day forecast for each location, using data from OpenWeather's API. 


### Technologies Used

Google Maps: provide a route for searched trips
OpenWeather: detailed five day forecast
This app uses JavaScript and jQuery for dynamically updating components of the page, as well as Bootstrap for design and styling.
